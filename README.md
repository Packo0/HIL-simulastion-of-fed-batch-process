# HIL-simulastion-of-fed-batch-process
The approach for fed-batch nonlinear model linearization is proposed. This is done by technique of closed-loop identification. The linear ARMAX of third order is obtained. On the basis of linearized model a LQG controller is designed. The system for HIL simulation of low cost embedded control system is developed. The fed-batch process is represented by SIMULINK model which is evaluated in real-time. The controller designed is embedded in Arduino Due kit. Controller and Simulink model exchange data via serial communication. Simulation and experimental results are given that confirm the workability of the embedded control system.
